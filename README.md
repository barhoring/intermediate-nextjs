Workshop with Scot moss

I created this repo to follow the couse with Scot moss

I created this first brnach bar-step/0 to follow remote/upstream/step/0
by doing something like this

```bash
npm install
git clone https://github.com/Hendrixer/intermediate-nextjs.git
cd intermediate-nextjs
git checkout step/0
npm install
```

then I created a file .env
that looks like this

```
TURSO_CONNECTION_URL=""
TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN=""
```
